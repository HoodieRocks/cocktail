# How to contribute to Cocktail
Thanks for showing interest into contributing to Cocktail, before you begin, please note a few things.

- We try and follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) for our commit messages
- Most changes should be done via pull requests
- Make sure to format your code before committing to prevent double committing, we use the defaults provided by [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- Kotlin has great Java Interop, and [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) does provide a way to convert Java to Kotlin. However, it's not recommended to commit Java to the repository because the conversion will sometimes add unnecessary safeties.
